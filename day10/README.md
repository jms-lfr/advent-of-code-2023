# [Advent of Code 2023: Day 10](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/10)

`make` generates `day10.exe`, which generates the solutions to both parts of Day 10.  
Usage: `.\day10.exe [filename]` (`filename` defaults to `input.txt`)  
Perfect file formatting assumed. S is assumed to be properly/legally connected to a loop of pipes.  
I didn't feel like accounting for every possible case of what/where S could be (first/last row, first/last char of row, pipes around it), so I just hardcoded it for what my input was.

# [Advent of Code 2023: Day 8](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/8)

`make` generates `day8.exe`, which generates the solutions to both parts of Day 8.  
Usage: `.\day8.exe [filename]` (`filename` defaults to `input.txt`)  
Perfect file formatting assumed, as well as the input having the same properties as the given AoC inputs (so we can make *a lot* of assumptions and use least common multiple for P2).  
AAA is assumed to be the start and ZZZ is assumed to be the end.

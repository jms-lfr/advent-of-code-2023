# [Advent of Code 2023: Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1)

`make` generates `day1p1.exe` and `day1p2.exe`, which generate the solutions to Day 1 Part 1 and Day 1 Part 2, respectively.  
Usage: `.\day1pX.exe [filename]` (`filename` defaults to `input.txt`)  
Part 2 Note: Cases with "zero" or uppercase letters are unaccounted for.

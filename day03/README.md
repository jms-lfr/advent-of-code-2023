# [Advent of Code 2023: Day 3](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3)

`make` generates `day3p1.exe` and `day3p2.exe`, which generate the solutions to Day 3 Part 1 and 2, respectively.  
Usage: `.\day3pX.exe [filename]` (`filename` defaults to `input.txt`)  
Lines assumed to all be the same length.  
Perfect file formatting assumed.  
Part 1 Note: It is *not* assumed that no number touches more than one symbol (even though that is the case in the AoC input).  
Part 2 Note: 0 will not be considered as part of a gear ratio.
